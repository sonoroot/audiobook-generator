At 04 hours 10 minutes, ship time, the Niccola was well inside the
Theta Gisol solar system. She had previously secured excellent evidence
that this was not the home of the Plumie civilization. There was no tuned
radiation. There was no evidence of interplanetary travel--rockets would
be more than obvious, and a magnetronic drive had a highly characteristic
radiation-pattern--so the real purpose of the Niccola's voyage would
not be accomplished here. She wouldn't find out where Plumies came from.
